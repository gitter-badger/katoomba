Read a ServiceCatalographer instance and create a report for each service.

Currently, this is geared towards reading BiodiversityCatalogue and reporting
to the BioVeL Wiki.

## Setup
Katoomba requires Python 3 and the Python `isodate`, `markdown` and `requests` packages.

On recent Debian/Ubuntu distributions:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3 pip3
$ sudo pip3 install isodate markdown requests
```

Copy the file `config.py.in` to `config.py` and edit the values.

## Running

Change to the directory containing this README file, and run using:
```
./katoomba
```
